	abstract = {The Gulf Stream strongly interacts with the topography along the southeastern U.S. seaboard, between the Straits of Florida and Cape Hatteras. The dynamics of the Gulf Stream in this region is investigated with a set of realistic, very high-resolution simulations using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The mean path is strongly inï¬uenced by the topography and in particular the Charleston Bump. There are signiï¬cant local pressure anomalies and topographic form stresses exerted by the bump that retard the mean ï¬ow and steer the mean current pathway seaward. The topography provides, through bottom pressure torque, the positive input of barotropic vorticity necessary to balance the meridional transport of ï¬uid and close the gyrescale vorticity balance. The effect of the topography on the development of meanders and eddies is studied by computing energy budgets of the eddies and the mean ï¬ow. The baroclinic instability is stabilized by the slope everywhere except past the bump. The ï¬ow is barotropically unstable, and kinetic energy is converted from the mean ï¬ow to the eddies following the Straits of Florida and at the bump with regions of eddy-to-mean conversion in between. There is eddy growth by Reynolds stress and downstream development of the eddies. Interaction of the ï¬ow with the topography acts as an external forcing process to localize these oceanic storm tracks. Associated time-averaged eddy ï¬uxes are essential to maintain and reshape the mean current. The pattern of eddy ï¬uxes is interpreted in terms of eddy life cycle, eddy ï¬uxes being directed downgradient in eddy growth regions and upgradient in eddy decay regions.},

It is novel in three main respects: the treatment of grid reï¬nement at the fast mode (barotropic) level; the use of scale selective update schemes; the conservation of both volume and tracer contents via reï¬uxing. An idealized application to vortex propagation on a b plane shows agreement between nested and high resolution solutions. A realistic application to the California Current System then conï¬rm these results in a complex conï¬guration. The selected algorithm is now part of ROMS\_AGRIF. It is fully consistent with ROMS parallel capabilities on both shared and distributed memory architectures. The nesting implementation authorizes several nesting levels and several grids at any particular level. This operational capability, combined with the inner qualities of our two-way nesting algorithm and generally high-order accuracy of ROMS numerics, allow for realistic simulation of coastal and ocean dynamics at multiple, interacting scales.},

	abstract = {The Gulf Stream (GS) is known to have a strong inï¬uence on climate, for example, by transporting heat from the tropics to higher latitudes. Although the GS transport intensity presents a clear interannual variability, satellite observations reveal its mean path is stable. Numerical models can simulate some characteristics of the mean GS path, but persistent biases keep the GS separation and postseparation unstable and therefore unrealistic. This study investigates how the integration of ocean surface currents into the oceanâatmosphere coupling interface of numerical models impacts the GS. The authors show for the ï¬rst time that the current feedback, through its eddy killing effect, stabilizes the GS separation and postseparation, resolving long-lasting biases in modeled GS path, at least for the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). This key process should therefore be taken into account in oceanic numerical models. Using a set of oceanic and atmospheric coupled and uncoupled simulations, this study shows that the current feedback, by modulating the energy transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, has two main effects on the ocean. On one hand, by reducing the mean surface stress and thus weakening the mean geostrophic wind work by 30\%, the current feedback slows down the whole North Atlantic oceanic gyre, making the GS narrower and its transport weaker. Yet, on the other hand, the current feedback acts as an oceanic eddy killer, reducing the surface eddy kinetic energy by 27\%. By inducing a surface stress curl opposite to the current vorticity, it deï¬ects energy from the geostrophic current into the atmosphere and dampens eddies.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis of ocean climate variability. In the assimilation, a model forecast produced by an ocean general circulation model with an average resolution of 0.25Â° Ï« 0.4Â° Ï« 40 levels is continuously corrected by contemporaneous observations with corrections estimated every 10 days. The basic reanalysis, SODA 1.4.2, spans the 44-yr period from 1958 to 2001, which complements the span of the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA-40). The observation set for this experiment includes the historical archive of hydrographic profiles supplemented by ship intake measurements, moored hydrographic observations, and remotely sensed SST. A parallel run, SODA 1.4.0, is forced with identical surface boundary conditions, but without data assimilation. The new reanalysis represents a significant improvement over a previously published version of the SODA algorithm. In particular, eddy kinetic energy and sea level variability are much larger than in previous versions and are more similar to estimates from independent observations. One issue addressed in this paper is the relative importance of the model forecast versus the observations for the analysis. The results show that at near-annual frequencies the forecast model has a strong influence, whereas at decadal frequencies the observations become increasingly dominant in the analysis. As a consequence, interannual variability in SODA 1.4.2 closely resembles interannual variability in SODA 1.4.0. However, decadal anomalies of the 0â700-m heat content from SODA 1.4.2 more closely resemble heat content anomalies based on observations.},

	abstract = {The In Situ Analysis System (ISAS) was developed to produce gridded ï¬elds of temperature and salinity that preserve as much as possible the time and space sampling capabilities of the Argo network of proï¬ling ï¬oats. Since the ï¬rst global reanalysis performed in 2009, the system has evolved, and a careful delayed-mode processing of the 2002â12 dataset has been carried out using version 6 of ISAS and updating the statistics to produce the ISAS13 analysis. This last version is now implemented as the operational analysis tool at the Coriolis data center. The robustness of the results with respect to the system evolution is explored through global quantities of climatological interest: the ocean heat content and the steric height. Estimates of errors consistent with the methodology are computed. This study shows that building reliable statistics on the ï¬elds is fundamental to improve the monthly estimates and to determine the absolute error bars. The new mean ï¬elds and variances deduced from the ISAS13 reanalysis and dataset show signiï¬cant changes relative to the previous ISAS estimates, in particular in the Southern Ocean, justifying the iterative procedure. During the decade covered by Argo, the intermediate waters appear warmer and saltier in the North Atlantic and fresher in the Southern Ocean than in World Ocean Atlas 2005 long-term mean. At interannual scale, the impact of ENSO on the ocean heat content and steric height is observed during the 2006/07 and 2009/10 events captured by the network.},

	abstract = {The use of r-coordinate ocean models has historically been considered a disadvantage for large-scale climate studies. The main reason resides in the non-alignment of the vertical coordinate isosurfaces with either geopotential surfaces or isopycnals making it harder to accurately compute the horizontal pressure gradient, advection, and isoneutral tracer diffusion. Moreover, this class of model requires a vertical mixing parameterization robust to large changes in the vertical resolution between shallow and deep areas. In this paper we show that, with some adjustments of the tracer advection, the surface boundary layer parameterization and the vertical grid, a r-coordinate model can achieve an accurate representation of the oceanic interior and mixed-layer dynamics. To do so, a new way of handling the temporal discretization of the rotated biharmonic operator is used to achieve tracer variance dissipation in an adiabatic and computationally efï¬cient way. Furthermore, a redesign of the K-Proï¬le surface layer Parameterization (KPP) to improve the regularity of the solution and the overall numerical efï¬ciency of the scheme is introduced. To validate the new algorithmic developments, we perform a set of coarse-resolution realistic basin-scale Paciï¬c simulations. Besides improving the conservation of water mass properties, the use of an isoneutral tracer hyperdiffusion is shown to have a negative feedback on the circulation error growth rate, thus signiï¬cantly reducing the sensitivity of the model solution to the degree of topographic smoothing. The overall validation of our simulations, focusing on the key characteristics of the circulation in the Paciï¬c Ocean, provides some evidence of the efï¬cacy of a terrain-following coordinate for large scale applications.},

Meanwhile their deep displacements can be used to map the ocean circulation at their drifting depth (mostly around 1000 m). A comprehensive processing of the whole Argo dataset collected prior to 1 January 2010 has been performed to produce a world-wide dataset of deep displacements. This numerical atlas, named ANDRO, after a traditional dance of Brittany meaning a swirl, comprises some 600 000 deep displacements. These displacements, based on Argo or GPS surface locations only, have been fully checked and corrected for possible errors found in the public Argo data ï¬les (due to incorrect decoding or instrumental failure). Park pressures measured by the ï¬oats while drifting at depth are preserved in ANDRO (less than 2\% of the park pressures are unknown): 63\% of the ï¬oat displacements are in the layer (900, 1100) dbar with a good (more or less uniform) degree of coverage of all the oceans, except around Antarctica (south of 608S). Two deeper layersâ(1400, 1600) and (1900, 2100) dbarâare also sampled (11\% and 8\% of the ï¬oat displacements, respectively) but with poorer geographical coverage. Grounded cycles (i.e., if the ï¬oat hits the sea bottom) are excluded. ANDRO is available online as an ASCII ï¬le.},

	abstract = {This variant of technical paper accompanies the release of public dataset YoMaHa'07 (the update of YoMaHaâ05) and provides a brief description of its structure and the techniques used for its preparation. The dataset contains estimates of velocities of deep and surface currents obtained using data of the trajectories from Argo floats. It includes data from 4284 floats stored in nine Data Assembly Centers (DACâs) worldwide and about 297,000 values of velocity. This is a 41\% increase in the number of floats and 78\% increase in the amount of data compared to YoMaHaâ05. The data span the period from August 04, 1997 through May 15, 2007. Surface velocities are linearly regressed from float coordinates fixed by the ARGOS satellites. Deep velocities are estimates from floats displacements during each submerged phase of the cycle. Both surface and deep velocities are accompanied by error estimates, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than velocity values. The paper describes data distribution in space, time and between the DACâs as well as probability distributions of programmed float parameters and statistics of their displacements. Possible application of the dataset is illustrated on the example of the ensemble-mean velocity field.},

This improvement appears to represent a regime shift in the dynamics of the simulated ï¬ow as the horizontal grid spacing decreases to around 10 km. Nevertheless, some signiï¬cant biases in the simulated circulation and substantial uncertainties about the robustness of these results with respect to parameterization choices remain. A growing collection of simulations obtained with the POP primitive equation model allow us to investigate the convergence properties and sensitivity of high resolution numerical simulations of the North Atlantic, with particular attention given to Gulf Stream separation and the subsequent path of the North Atlantic Current into the Northwest Corner. Increases in resolution and reductions in dissipation both contribute to the improvements in the circulation seen in recent studies. We ï¬nd that our highest resolution eddy-resolving simulations retain an appreciable sensitivity to the closure scheme. Our most realistic simulations of the Gulf Stream are not obtained at the lowest levels of dissipation, while the simulation of the North Atlantic Current continues to improve as dissipation is reduced to near the numerical stability limit. In consequence, there is a limited range of parameter space where both aspects of the simulated circulation can be brought into agreement with observations. This experience gained with the comparatively aï¬ordable regional North Atlantic model is now being used to conï¬gure the next generation of ocean climate models.},

Predictions that a threshold in resolution was yet to be crossed proved to be true: 1/10â¦ or higher-resolution models are now capable of producing Gulf Stream separation at the observed location of Cape Hatteras, and other features of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current system are much more realistically represented. The surface expression of eddy kinetic energy agrees well between models and observations. Mesoscale eddies also invigorate the deep circulation, which in turn improves the mean circulation via enhanced current-topography interactions. The successful generation of these prominent features of the circulation, however, is found to depend sensitively on model conï¬guration issues that are not yet fully understood. More generally, the North Atlantic basin remains a particularly well-observed region in which high-resolution models can be used to explore fundamental issues in physical oceanography, such as the manner in which the turbulent variability feeds back on the large scale mean circulation, and the related issue of the range of spatial and temporal scales required in order to adequately describe the circulation.},

The shallow water model acts as an effective ï¬lter and clearly reveals the transport driven by each term.

The model contains a correction to the North Atlantic ï¬ow ï¬eld to improve the path of the North Atlantic Current, thereby alleviating the surface cold bias, a common problem with climate models, and offering a unique opportunity to study the AMV in a model. Changes in greenhouse gas forcing or aerosol loading are not considered. A striking feature of the results is the contrast between the western and eastern sides of the subpolar gyre in the model. On the western side, anomalous heat supply by the ocean plays a major role, with most of this heat being given up to the atmosphere in the warm phase, largely symmetrically about the time of the AMV maximum. By contrast, on the eastern side, the ocean anomalously gains heat from the atmosphere, with relatively little role for ocean heat supply in the years before the AMV maximum. Thereafter, the balance changes with heat now being anomalously removed from the eastern side by the ocean, leading to a reduced ocean heat content, behavior associated with the establishment of an intergyre gyre at the time of the AMV maximum. In the warm phase, melting sea ice leads to a freshening of surface waters northeast of Greenland that travel southward into the Irminger and Labrador Seas, shutting down convection and terminating the AMV warm phase.},

	volume = {38},
	abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that the North Atlantic Ocean subpolar gyre circulation undergoes significant interannual-to-decadal changes in response to variability in atmospheric forcing. There are also observations, however, suggesting that the southern limb of the subpolar gyre, namely, the eastward-flowing North Atlantic Current (NAC), may be quasi-locked to particular latitudes in the central North Atlantic by fracture zones (gaps) in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This could constrain the currentâs ability to respond to variability in forcing. In the present study, subsurface float trajectories at 100â1000 m collected during 1997â99 and satellite-derived surface geostrophic velocities from 1992 to 2006 are used to provide an improved description of the detailed pathways of the NAC over the ridge and their relationship to bathymetry. Both the float and satellite observations indicate that in 1997â99, the northern branch of the NAC was split into two branches as it crossed the ridge, one quasi-locked to the CharlieâGibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ; 52Â°â53Â°N) and the other to the Faraday Fracture Zone (50Â°â51Â°N). The longer satellite time series shows, however, that this pattern did not persist outside the float sampling period and that other branching modes persisted for one or more years, including an approximately 12-month time period in 2002â03 when the strongest eastward flow over the ridge was at Ï³49Â°N. Schott et al. showed how northward excursions of the NAC can temporarily block the westward flow of the IcelandâScotland Overflow Water through the CGFZ. From the 13-yr time series of surface geostrophic velocity, it is estimated that such blocking may occur on average 6\% of the time, although estimates for any given 12-month period range from 0\% to 35\%.},

At the surface, the model velocities agree generally well with World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) drifter data. Two noticeable exceptions are the weakness of the East Greenland coastal current in models and the presence in the surface layers of a strong southwestward East Reykjanes Ridge Current. At depths, the most prominent feature of the circulation is the boundary current following the continental slope. In this narrow flow, it is found that gridded float datasets cannot be used for a quantitative comparison with models. The models have very different patterns of deep convection, and it is suggested that this could be related to the differences in their barotropic transport at Cape Farewell. Models show a large drift in watermass properties with a salinization of the Labrador Sea Water. The authors believe that the main cause is related to horizontal transports of salt because models with different forcing and vertical mixing share the same salinization problem. A remarkable feature of the model solutions is the large westward transport over Reykjanes Ridge [10 Sv (Sv Ïµ 106 m3 sÏª1) or more].},

In the simulation, deep water formation takes place in the Irminger Sea, in the interior of the Labrador Sea and in the Labrador Current. In the Irminger Sea, deep water is formed close to the boundary currents. It is rapidly exported out of the Irminger Sea via an intensiï¬ed East Greenland Current, and out of the Labrador Sea via increased southeastward transports. The newly formed deep water, which is advected to Flemish Cap in approximately one year, is preceded by fast propagating topographic waves. Deep water formed in the Labrador Sea interior tends to accumulate and recirculate within the basin, with a residence time of a few years in the Labrador Sea. Hence, it is only slowly exported northeastward to the Irminger Sea and southeastward to the subtropical North Atlantic, reaching Flemish Cap in 1â5 years. As a result, the transport in the Deep Western Boundary Current is mostly correlated with convection in the Irminger Sea. Finally, the deep water produced in the Labrador Current is lighter and is rapidly exported out of the Labrador Basin, reaching Flemish Cap in a few months. As the production of deep-water along the western periphery of the Labrador Sea is maximum when convection in the interior is minimum, there is some compensation between the deep water formed along the boundary and in the interior of the basin, which reduces the variability of its net transport. These mechanisms which have been suggested from hydrographic and tracer observations, help one to understand the variability of the transport in the Deep Western Boundary Current at the exit of the subpolar gyre.},

	abstract = {The decadal mean circulation in the northern North Atlantic was assessed for the early 21st century from repeated ship-based measurements along the Greenland-Portugal OVIDE line, from satellite altimetry and from earlier reported transports across 59.5Â°N and at the Greenland-Scotland sills. The remarkable quantitative agreement between all data sets allowed us to draw circulation pathways with a high level of conï¬dence. The North Atlantic Current (NAC) system is composed of three main branches, referred to as the northern, central and southern branches, which were traced from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), to the Irminger Sea, the Greenland-Scotland Ridge and the subtropical gyre. At OVIDE, the northern and central branches of the NAC ï¬ll the whole water column and their top-to-bottom integrated transports were estimated at 11.0 Â± 3 Sv and 14.2 Â± 6.4 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 sÃ1), respectively. Those two branches feed the cyclonic circulation in the Iceland Basin and the ï¬ow over the Reykjanes Ridge into the Irminger Sea. This cross-ridge ï¬ow was estimated at 11.3 Â± 4.2 Sv westward, north of 58.5Â°N. The southern NAC branch is strongly surface-intensiï¬ed and most of its top-to-bottom integrated transport, estimated at 16.6 Â± 2 Sv, is found in the upper layer. It is composed of two parts: the northern part contributes to the ï¬ow over the Rockall Plateau and through the Rockall Trough toward the Iceland-Scotland Ridge; the southern part feeds the anticyclonic circulation toward the subtropical gyre. Summing over the three NAC branches, the top-to-bottom transport of the NAC across OVIDE was estimated at 41.8 Â± 3.7 Sv. Because of the surface-intensiï¬cation of the southern NAC branch, the intermediate water is transported to the northeast Atlantic mostly by the northern and central branches of the NAC (11.9 Â± 1.8 Sv eastward). This water circulates cyclonically in the Iceland Basin and anticyclonically in the West European Basin, with similar transport intensities. In the deep layer of the Iceland Basin, Iceland-Scotland Overï¬ow Water (ISOW) spreads southwestward along three pathways on the eastern ï¬ank of the Reykjanes Ridge. The associated transport was estimated at 3.2 Â± 0.4 Sv. The two shallowest pathways turn around the Reykjanes Ridge toward the Irminger Sea where they head northward. A northeastward transport of deep water is observed in the deep extension of the northern and central branches of the NAC, east of the MAR. In the Irminger Sea our transport estimates for the Irminger Current, Irminger Gyre, East Greenland Irminger Current and Deep Western Boundary Current are in line with previous work.},

This FBC overflow is part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which has recently been suggested to have weakened. From November 1995 to May 2015, the FBC overflow has been monitored by a continuous ADCP (acoustic Doppler current profiler) mooring, which has been deployed in the middle of this narrow channel. Combined with regular hydrography cruises and several short-term mooring experiments, this allowed us to construct time series of volume transport and to follow changes in the hydrographic properties and density of the FBC overflow. The mean kinematic overflow, derived solely from the velocity field, was found to be (2.2{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}Â±{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.2){\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}Sv (1{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}Sv{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}â=â{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}10$^{\textrm{6}}${\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m$^{\textrm{3}}${\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}s$^{\textrm{â1}}$) with a slight, but not statistically significant, positive trend. The coldest part, and probably the bulk, of the FBC overflow warmed by a bit more than 0.1{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}Â°C, especially after 2002, increasing the transport of heat into the deep ocean. This warming was, however, accompanied by increasing salinities, which seem to have compensated for the temperature-induced density decrease. Thus, the FBC overflow has remained stable in volume transport as well as density during the 2 decades from 1995 to 2015. After crossing the GSR, the overflow is modified by mixing and entrainment, but the associated change in volume (and heat) transport is still not well known. Whatever effect this has on the AMOC and the global energy balance, our observed stability of the FBC overflow is consistent with reported observations from the other main overflow branch, the Denmark Strait overflow, and the three Atlantic inflow branches to the Arctic Mediterranean that feed the overflows. If the AMOC has weakened during the last 2 decades, it is not likely to have been due to its northernmost extension â the exchanges across the GreenlandâScotland Ridge.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Based on the array measurements during this period the ISOW plume exhibited a time mean volume transport of 3.87 0.6 Sv (standard error, 1 SvÂ¼ 106 m3/s). The transport estimate favorably compares with other recent estimates obtained by different methods, conï¬rming that the fate of the ISOW plume downstream of the array is far from being fully understood. Historical observations show that drainage of ISOW through CharlieâGibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ) only amounts to 60\% of our upstream transport estimate. To date, no reliable transport estimates of the fractions of ISOW recirculating within the Iceland Basin or being drained through fracture zones other than CGFZ do exist. Our observed 2-years-long transport time series show pronounced subseasonal variability with a standard deviation of 1.3 Sv. Simultaneous hydrographic observations reveal, that temporal changes in the strength of the ï¬ow go along with changes in the water mass properties. Periods of stronger ï¬ow within the ISOW plume coincide with a reduction in salinity.},

	abstract = {The general circulation of the Labrador Sea is studied with a dataset of 53 surface drifters drogued at 15 m and several hydrographic sections done in May 1997. Surface drifters indicate three distinct speed regimes: fast boundary currents, a slower crossover from Greenland to Labrador, and a slow, eddy-dominated ï¬ow in the basin interior. Mean Eulerian velocity maps show several recirculation cells located offshore of the main currents, in addition to the cyclonic circulation of the Labrador Sea. Above the northern slope of the basin, the surface drifters have two preferential paths: one between the 1000-m and 2000-m isobaths and the other close to the 3000-m isobath. The vertical shear estimated from CTD data supports the presence of two distinct currents around the basin. One current, more baroclinic, ï¬ows between the 1000-m and 2000-m isobaths. The other one, more barotropic, ï¬ows above the lower continental slope. The Irminger Sea Water carried by the boundary currents is altered as it travels around the basin. Proï¬ling Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorer (PALACE) ï¬oats that followed approximately the Irminger Sea Water in the Labrador Sea show signs of isopycnal mixing between the interior and the boundary current in summerâfall and convection across the path of the Irminger Sea Water in winterâspring.},

The western boundary currents from surface to seaï¬oor transport 40.5 6 8.1 Sv (Sv [ 106 m3 s21) southward in the Irminger Sea, and 53.8 6 10.8 Sv northward in the Labrador Sea. The Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC, deï¬ned as water with potential density greater than 27.80 kg m23) transports 12.3 6 2.5 Sv southward in the Irminger Sea. The deep water transport is reduced south of Cape Farewell, where it changes ï¬ow direction from southward to northward (the south corner). At a section over the Eirik Ridge, a bathymetric feature extending southwest of Cape Farewell, the DWBC transports 8.7 6 1.7 Sv westward. The reduction in transport at the south corner is associated with decreased velocities within the deepest layers and the volumetric loss of the most saline deep water types. The observations suggest that the paths of the shallow and deep western boundary currents diverge at the south corner. Downstream in the eastern Labrador Sea the deep water transport is increased to 19.7 6 3.9 Sv northward, with the addition of recirculating denser deep waters. The representativeness of the results from the semisynoptic survey is discussed with reference to companion current meter measurements of the DWBC.},

Idealized analytical and numerical models forced with such variable winds over a sloping bottom reproduce the essential aspects of the observed gyres (strength, location, and horizontal and vertical length scales). The communication between the forcing region in the Irminger Sea and the recirculation to the west is achieved by baroclinic topographic Rossby wave propagation along potential vorticity contours. The circulation is characterized as a time-dependent, stratiï¬ed, topographic beta plume. For weak stratiï¬cation, as found in the subpolar North Atlantic, the recirculation strength exhibits only weak seasonal variability, consistent with the observations, even though the forcing is active only during the winter. Baroclinic Rossby waves that develop when the wind forcing ceases in springtime interact with the bottom to provide a source of cyclonic vorticity that maintains the circulation until the wind strengthens again in the following winter.},

We present a statistical analysis of these drift velocity data, and describe the features of the circulation from 400â1500 m depth as measured by the ï¬oats. The time-lagged auto-covariances of velocity indicate a Lagrangian integral time scale of approximately 10 days at all drift depths and throughout the basin. Spaceâtime averages of velocity and the associated error ellipses were constructed, and this information was used in an objective analysis to produce estimates of the multiyear mean ï¬ow. Estimates of eddy kinetic energy were also computed. The mapped ï¬ow depicts a basin-scale cyclonic gyre bounded in the south by the North Atlantic Current. The strongest currents are found along the coasts of Greenland and Labrador, where mean speeds exceed 10 cm sÃ1: Closed cyclonic recirculations appear just offshore of the boundary currents in the Labrador and Irminger Seas and in the Iceland basin, and also southwest of the Reykjanes Ridge. Topographic steering extends upwards to at least 400 m depth above bathymetry that is signiï¬cantly deeper, and is most apparent in ï¬ow along basin boundaries, around the Reykjanes Ridge, and through gaps in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the center of the basin-scale gyre and to the south of the North Atlantic Current ï¬ow is characteristically weak with few large-scale circulation features. There is no indication of a strong linkage along the western boundary from the subpolar to subtropical gyre at depths sampled by ï¬oats.},

	volume = {45},
	abstract = {The vorticity dynamics associated with the mean and time-varying gyre and overturning circulations of the Atlantic Ocean are examined in a realistic ocean model hindcast simulation of the late twentieth century. Abyssal ï¬ow interaction with sloping bottom bathymetry gives rise to the bottom pressure torque (BPT) term of the vertically integrated vorticity equation. The dominance of this term in the closure of the barotropic gyre circulation noted in previous studies is corroborated here for both non-eddy-resolving and eddy-resolving versions of the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) model. This study shows that BPT is also a dominant term in the vorticity balance of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and therefore represents a key dynamical link between the overturning and gyre streamfunctions. The interannual variability of the Atlantic circulation over the last several decades, viewed in terms of time-varying integral vorticity balances, demonstrates the fundamental role played by BPT in coupling the large-scale barotropic and baroclinic ï¬ows. Forcing perturbation experiments show how ï¬owâbathymetry interactions mediate buoyancy-driven changes in the gyre circulation and momentum-driven changes in the AMOC. Examples of topographic coupling of the overturning and gyre circulations that this analysis elucidates include the covariation of the high-latitude AMOC and subpolar gyre ï¬ows on decadal time scales, buoyancy-forced variance of the Gulf Stream, and large wind-driven variations in AMOC at subtropical latitudes.},

This implies that viscous torques are not important in western boundary currents, their place being taken by bottom pressure torques. The prediction is conï¬rmed in the context of a global, eddy-permitting, numerical ocean model.

The time-averaged flow at all five moorings had a strong baroclinic character. The mean circulation in the upper layers with relatively warm Sub-Polar Mode Water appears to have a general north-eastward direction with maximum mean velocities of 6 to 7 cm.s "1. In the bottom layer south of Iceland, where the cold IcelandScotland Overflow Water flows westwards along the topography in a Deep Northern Boundary Current, mean velocities of the order of 10 to 20 cm-s" have been observed. Over the deep slope of the Hatton Bank, water enters the Iceland Basin in a branch of the Deep Northern Boundary Current which has a cyclonic rotation sense in the Iceland Basin. The variable part of the current has been analysed by means of principal-component analysis. The current variations in the central Iceland Basin appear to have a mainly barotropic character while variations in the baroclinic flow of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water contributed 10\% or less to the total energy of the variable deep flow. Over the slope of the Hatton Bank the variable currents had a mainly baroclinic character with shear in both current speed and direction. Comparison of the geostrophic velocity with the mean Eulerian velocity has revealed that the ae=27.725 kg.m "3 surface can be used adequately as level of no-motion for the geostrophic modelling of the flow along the Icelandic and Hatton slopes. The mean westward geostrophic transport of ISOW south of Iceland relative to this reference surface amounted to 3.5 Sv, in agreement with existing independent estimates.},

Pedloskyâs investigation of the eddy-formation mechanism in the eastern Labrador Sea by including a more realistic depiction of the boundary current. The quasigeostrophic model consists of a meridional, coastally trapped current with three vertical layers. The current configuration and topographic domain are chosen to match, as closely as possible, the observations of the boundary current and the varying topographic slope along the West Greenland coast. The role played by the bottomintensified component of the boundary current on the formation of the Labrador Sea Irminger Rings is explored. Consistent with the earlier study, a short, localized bottom-trapped wave is responsible for most of the perturbation energy growth. However, for the instability to occur in the three-layer model, the deepest component of the boundary current must be sufficiently strong, highlighting the importance of the near-bottom flow. The model is able to reproduce important features of the observed vortices in the eastern Labrador Sea, including the polarity, radius, rate of formation, and vertical structure. At the time of formation, the eddies have a surface signature as well as a strong circulation at depth, possibly allowing for the transport of both surface and near-bottom water from the boundary current into the interior basin. This work also supports the idea that changes in the current structure could be responsible for the observed interannual variability in the number of Irminger Rings formed.},

In the bottom layer south of Iceland, where the cold IcelandScotland Overflow Water flows westwards along the topography in a Deep Northern Boundary Current, mean velocities of the order of 10 to 20 cm-s" have been observed. Over the deep slope of the Hatton Bank, water enters the Iceland Basin in a branch of the Deep Northern Boundary Current which has a cyclonic rotation sense in the Iceland Basin. The variable part of the current has been analysed by means of principal-component analysis. The current variations in the central Iceland Basin appear to have a mainly barotropic character while variations in the baroclinic flow of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water contributed 10\% or less to the total energy of the variable deep flow. Over the slope of the Hatton Bank the variable currents had a mainly baroclinic character with shear in both current speed and direction. Comparison of the geostrophic velocity with the mean Eulerian velocity has revealed that the ae=27.725 kg.m "3 surface can be used adequately as level of no-motion for the geostrophic modelling of the flow along the Icelandic and Hatton slopes.

	abstract = {Recent realistic high resolution modeling studies show a net increase of submesoscale activity in fall and winter when the mixed layer depth is at its maximum. This submesoscale activity increase is associated with a reduced deepening of the mixed layer. Both phenomena can be related to the development of mixed layer instabilities, which convert available potential energy into submesoscale eddy kinetic energy and contribute to a fast restratiï¬cation by slumping the horizontal density gradient in the mixed layer. In the present work, the mixed layer formation and restratiï¬cation were studied by uniformly cooling a fully turbulent zonal jet in a periodic channel at different resolutions, from eddy resolving (10 km) to submesoscale permitting (2 km). The effect of the submesoscale activity, highlighted by these different horizontal resolutions, was quantiï¬ed in terms of mixed layer depth, restratiï¬cation rate and buoyancy ï¬uxes. Contrary to many idealized studies focusing on the restratiï¬cation phase only, this study addresses a continuous event of mixed layer formation followed by its complete restratiï¬cation. The robustness of the present results was established by ensemble simulations. The results show that, at higher resolution, when submesoscale starts to be resolved, the mixed layer formed during the surface cooling is signiï¬cantly shallower and the total restratiï¬cation is almost three times faster. Such differences between coarse and ï¬ne resolution models are consistent with the submesoscale upward buoyancy ï¬ux, which balances the convection during the formation phase and accelerates the restratiï¬cation once the surface cooling is stopped. This submesoscale buoyancy ï¬ux is active even below the mixed layer. Our simulations show that mesoscale dynamics also cause restratiï¬cation, but on longer time scales. Finally, the spatial distribution of the mixed layer depth is highly heterogeneous in the presence of submesoscale activity, prompting the question of whether it is possible to parameterize submesoscale effects and their effects on the marine biology as a function of a spatially-averaged mixed layer depth.},

The model output, covering the 1990â2004 period, shows strong similarities to observations of the Irminger Current as well as ring observations at a mooring located offshore of the eddy formation region in 2007â09. An analysis of ï¬uxes in the model shows that while the majority of heat exchange with the interior indeed occurs at the site of the Irminger Current instability, the contribution of the coherent Irminger rings is modest (18\%). Heat is provided to the convective region mainly through noncoherent anomalies and enhanced local mixing by the rings facilitating further exchange between the boundary and interior. The time variability of the eddy kinetic energy and the boundary to interior heat ï¬ux in the model are strongly correlated to the density gradient between the dense convective region and the more buoyant boundary current. In FLAME, the density variations of the boundary current are larger than those of the convective region, thereby largely controlling changes in lateral ï¬uxes. Synchronous long-term trends in temperature in the boundary and the interior over the 15-yr simulation suggest that the heat ï¬ux relative to the temperature of the interior is largely steady on these time scales.},

The surface expression of eddy kinetic energy agrees well between models and observations. Mesoscale eddies also invigorate the deep circulation, which in turn improves the mean circulation via enhanced current-topography interactions. The successful generation of these prominent features of the circulation, however, is found to depend sensitively on model conï¬guration issues that are not yet fully understood. More generally, the North Atlantic basin remains a particularly well-observed region in which high-resolution models can be used to explore fundamental issues in physical oceanography, such as the manner in which the turbulent variability feeds back on the large scale mean circulation, and the related issue of the range of spatial and temporal scales required in order to adequately describe the circulation.},

These integrated budgets are shown to be consistent across model platforms and resolution, suggesting that these balances are robust. Two of the simulations, at 100- and 10-km resolutions, produce a more northerly separating Gulf Stream but obtain the correct integrated vorticity balances. In these simulations, viscous torque is nonnegligible on smaller scales, indicating that the separation is linked to the details of the local dynamics. These results are shown to be consistent with a scale analysis argument that suggests that the biharmonic viscous torque in particular is upsetting the inviscid balance in simulations with a more northerly separation. In addition to providing evidence for locally controlled inviscid separation, these results provide motivation to revisit the formulation of subgrid-scale parameterizations in general circulation models.},

Using a kinematic model, objective estimates of eddy length scales and velocity structure are made for 16 eddies. Anticyclones had a mean core diameter of 12 km, and their mean peak observed azimuthal speed was 0.1 m s21. They had core salinities and potential temperatures of 34.91â34.98 and 4.488â5.348C, respectively, making them warm and salty features. These properties represent a typical salinity anomaly of 0.03 and a temperature anomaly of 0.288C from noneddy values. All eddies had small (1) Rossby numbers. In 2006, the glider observed two anticyclones having diameters of about 20 km and peak azimuthal speeds of about 0.3 m s21. Similar salinity anomalies were detected throughout the Irminger Sea by ï¬oats proï¬ling in anticyclones. Two formation regions for the eddies are identiï¬ed: one to the west of the Reykjanes Ridge and the other off the East Greenland Irminger Current near Cape Farewell close to the mooring. Observations indicate that eddies formed in the former region are larger than eddies observed at the mooring. A clear increase in eddy salinity is observed between 2002 and 2009. The observed breakup of these eddies in winter implies that they are a source of salt for the central gyre. The anticyclones are similar to those found in both the Labrador Sea and Norwegian Sea, making them a ubiquitous feature of the subpolar North Atlantic basins.},

Compared to the 1Â° and 1/4Â° equivalent versions, this simulation more realistically represents the shape of the Subpolar Gyre, the position of the North Atlantic Current, and the Gulf Stream separation. Other key improvements are found in the representation of boundary currents, multi-year variability of temperature and depth of winter mixing in the Labrador Sea, and the transport of overï¬ows at the GreenlandâScotland Ridge. However, the salinity, stratiï¬cation and mean depth of winter mixing in the Labrador Sea, and the density and depth of overï¬ow water south of the sill, still present challenges to the model. This simulation also provides further insight into the spatio-temporal development of the warming event observed in the Subpolar Gyre in the mid 1990s, which appears to coincide with a phase of increased eddy activity in the southernmost part of the gyre. This may have provided a gateway through which heat would have propagated into the gyre's interior.},

	abstract = {The deep circulation and related transports of the southern Labrador Sea are determined from direct current observations from ship surveys and a moored current-meter array. The measurements covered a time span from summer 1997 to 1999 and show a well-deï¬ned deep boundary current extending approximately out to the 3300-m depth contour and weak reverse currents farther offshore. The ï¬ow has a strong barotropic component, and signiï¬cant baroclinic ï¬ow is only found in the shallow Labrador Current at the shelf break and associated with a deep core of Denmark Strait Overï¬ow Water. The total deep-water transport below â´â° Ï­ 27.74 kg mÏª3 was 26 Ï® 5 Sv (Sv Ïµ 106 m3 sÏª1) comprising Labrador Sea Water (LSW), Gibbs Fracture Zone Water (GFZW), and Denmark Strait Overï¬ow Water (DSOW). Intraseasonal variability of the ï¬ow and transport was high, ranging from 15 to 35 Sv, and the annual means differed by 17\%. A seasonal cycle is conï¬ned to the shallow Labrador Current; in its deeper part, where the mean ï¬ow is still strong, no obvious seasonality could be detected. The transport of the interior anticyclonic recirculation was estimated from lowered acoustic Doppler current proï¬ler stations and geostrophy, yielding about 9 Sv. Thus, the net deep-water outï¬ow from the Labrador Sea was about 17 Sv. The baroclinic transport of GFZW and DSOW referenced to the depth of the isopycnal â´â° Ï­ 27.80 kg mÏª3 is only about one-third of the total transport in these layers. Longer-term variations of the total transports are not represented well by the baroclinic contribution.},

	abstract = {The conventional picture of an ocean gyre, based on an ocean with vertical sidewalls, assumes a balance between an input of vorticity by wind stress curl, and a viscous Â¯ux of vorticity through the boundary at the same latitude, resulting from a viscous western boundary current which may be signiÂ®cantly modiÂ®ed by nonlinear terms. Potential interactions with topography are also commonly acknowledged as a possible complicating factor. In this idealized picture, the zonal momentum balance is taken to be geostrophic, as numerous model analyses conÂ®rm. A theoretical argument is given here which shows that, in an ocean with sloping sidewalls, this geostrophic balance results in bottom pressure torques which balance the wind stress curl at each latitude. This removes the requirement for a viscous western boundary current at each latitude suggesting that the dynamics within a western boundary current may be essentially inviscid. While inviscid western boundary currents have already been found in certain idealized systems, and in one set of diagnostics from an eddy permitting model, the generality of the argument presented here gives a strong reason to believe that these are not special cases. Inviscid western boundary currents are in fact the rule, and the vertical sidewall case is an unrealistic exception. Ã 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The topographical control of western boundary currents within a basin and zonal jets in a channel is investigated in terms of the potential vorticity (PV) and barotropic vorticity (BV: the curl of the depthintegrated velocity) budgets using isopycnic, adiabatic windâdriven experiments. Along the western boundary, the wind-driven transport is returned across latitude lines by the bottom pressure torque, while friction is only important in altering the PV within an isopycnic layer and in allowing a closed circulation. These contrasting balances constrain the geometry of the flow through integral relationships for the BV and PV. For both homogenous and stratified basins with sloping sidewalls, the northward subtropical jet separates from the western wall and has opposing frictional torques on either side of the jet, which cancel in a zonal integral for BV but alter the PV within a layer streamline. In a channel with partial topographic barriers, the bottom pressure torque is again important in returning wind-driven flows along western boundaries and in transferring BV from neighboring wind-driven gyres into a zonal jet. The depth-integrated flow steered by topography controls where the bottom friction alters the PV, which can lead to different PV states being attained for separate subbasins along a channel.},

This study is motivated by several recent observational studies that ï¬nd that subsurface ï¬oats injected near the western boundary of the Labrador Sea most often do not continuously follow the deep western boundary current (DWBC), in contrast to the traditional view that the deep water formed in the North Atlantic predominantly follows the DWBC. It is found that, with imposed large viscosity values, the model reproduces the traditional view. However, as viscosity is reduced and the model bathymetry resolution increased, much of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) separates from the western boundary and enters the low-latitude Atlantic via interior pathways distinct from the DWBC. It is shown that bottom pressure torques play an important role in maintaining these interior NADW outï¬ows.},
